# Main data folder for ACLIM2 indices


## Get the data
* Go to the google drive and download the zipped file with the R ACLIM2 indices `ACLIM2_indices.zip`:
* [00_ACLIM_shared > 02_Data > Newest_Data(use this) > unzip_and_put_in_dat_out_folder_CMIP6](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1clPtrPCQMPcwqr8UE78_Sd2IGwyBuDcD)

* Unzip `K29P19_CMIP5.zip` or `K29P19_CMIP6.zip` files move the `K29P19_CMIP5` or `K29P19_CMIP6` folders to your local folder `ACLIM2/Data/out`. The result should be the following folder structure on your local computer:  
* `ACLIM2/Data/out/K29P19_CMIP6/allEBSmeans`: main folder with annual, monthly, seasonal, and survey replicated level 4 ACLIM indices
* `ACLIM2/Data/out/K29P19_CMIP6/BC_ACLIMregion`: Weekly x Strata based indices, including delta and bias corrected values (these are "rolled up" to become strata AREA weighted mean vals in the allEBSmeans folder).
* `ACLIM2/Data/out/K29P19_CMIP6/BC_ACLIMsurveyrep`: Survey replicated indices at each station, including delta and bias corrected values (these are "rolled up" to become average across station mean vals in the allEBSmeans folder).

* `ACLIM2/Data/out/K29P19_CMIP6/allEBSmeans`: as above but for CMIP5
* `ACLIM2/Data/out/K29P19_CMIP6/allEBSmeans`: as above but for CMIP5
* `ACLIM2/Data/out/K29P19_CMIP6/allEBSmeans`: as above but for CMIP5

## Individual models

Temperature anomalies for individual models can be found in separate folders for [cmip6](temperatures/cmip6/csv/) and [cmip5](temperatures/cmip5/csv/)

### Example
The data is available in csv files:
``` csv
model, ens, exp, postprocess, table, grid, varn, period, mean
CAMS-CSM1-0, r1i1p1f1, ssp119, global_mean, Amon, gn, tas, 2021-2040, 1.07
CNRM-ESM2-1, r1i1p1f2, ssp119, global_mean, Amon, gr, tas, 2021-2040, 1.32
CanESM5, r1i1p1f1, ssp119, global_mean, Amon, gn, tas, 2021-2040, 2.16
...
```

### Files

There are two files with [cmip6](temperatures/cmip6/csv/) data. One with one ensemble member per model and one with all ensemble members. For [cmip5](temperatures/cmip5/csv/) two additional files are provided. The reference period is 1850 to 1900, however, many cmip5 models only start after 1850 and are therefore excluded. These models are also included in the `*_no_bounds_check.yml` files.

## Data
 * Weekly strata temperature, productivity, and other data for `historical` and `projections` for each General Circulation Model (`GCM`)
   * `RCP4.5` and `RCP8.5` (CMIP5)
   * `SSP1-2.6` and `SSP5-8.5` (CMIP6)
